# Spelunky Classic HD HTML5

Web version of [Spelunky Classic HD](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD).

<p align="center"><img src="src/pwa/assets/screenshots/screenshot_02.png" width="80%"></p>

This version was built by targeting GX.games (not HTML5) in GameMaker and then modifying it. Essentially, it's a WebAssembly app, which means it should perform nearly as well as a native application.

**It is available as:**

- [PWA](https://yancharkin.github.io/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/) (playable online or installable as a standalone app)
- [Electron  app for macOS, ~~Linux and Windows~~](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/releases)*
- ~~[Cordova app for Android](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/releases)~~*

**The app can still be built for Linux, Windows, and Android, but Iâ€™ll no longer provide ready-to-use builds. Creating them takes time, and they offer no benefits over the PWA version. More PWA usage info can be found [here](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/blob/gh-pages/README.md).*
