# Spelunky Classic HD HTML5

Web version of [Spelunky Classic HD](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD).

<p align="center"><img src="src/pwa/assets/screenshots/screenshot_02.png" width="80%"></p>

This version was built by targeting GX.games (not HTML5) in GameMaker and then modifying it. Essentially, it's a WebAssembly app, which means it should perform nearly as well as a native application.

**It is available as:**

- [PWA](https://yancharkin.github.io/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/) (playable online or installable as a standalone app)
- [Electron  app for Linux, macOS and Windows](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/releases)
 - [Cordova app for Android](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/releases)

*Unless there's a specific reason not to, I recommend using the PWA version. More usage info can be found [here](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/blob/gh-pages/README.md). Non-PWA builds may not be available in the future.*
